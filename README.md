# Geometric-Sliders
The first ever project/game I built.

I am mainly posting this repo for legacy purposes, as this is where I feel I really gained my passion for development.

# History
Close to 4 years ago, I began teaching myself to develop through online books on python (resource: https://inventwithpython.com/). The desire to do so came from a girlfriend at the time who was taking a java class and sending me her neat little apps. Eventually, it seemed reasonable to learn enough development to design a game and see if it was a career I would be interested in. 

At first it was rough; running through the concepts of coding can be difficult to understand on one's own (barring a background in calculus). The initial struggle in learning made it apparent that it was worth going college for software development. 

# Design
I knew rather little about game design in general when I took on this project. I had been watching Extra Credits in my spare time to get as much exposure to industry experience as possible during development.

Some of my favorite types of games are tower defence and strategy based games. And I tried to incorporate aspect of them into this game.

After every feature, a close friend would test and give me feedback. He had spent much more time playing games than I have, so we made a pretty decent team.

# Deployment
Unfortunately I was still pretty naive when I made this and had attempted to turn Python code into a .exe (of which there were rather few libraries for at the time). CX_Freeze eventually did the trick, but with the rise of easy-deployment game engines like unity it was time to put python game development on the shelf.

# Live Version
This game can be experimented with at http://gamejolt.com/games/geometric-sliders/22253
